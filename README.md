# PyTower 
A high-level Python API for editing CondoData/.map files, similar to WorldEdit for Minecraft

## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to **Bree** for creating the first CondoData parser, please check it out here: https://github.com/brecert/tower-unite-suitebro

Additional thanks to **rileyzzz** for their inspiring work on TUEdit and the other amazing members of the tooling community, including: **Aman-Anony**, **Fennecs**, **TerrorBite**, and **Sinaboo**

PyTower wouldn't have been possible without their support, feedback, and early testing üíñ

## Dependencies
 - ‚≠êPython 3.10+
 - (Included in /lib): [tower-unite-suitebro](https://github.com/brecert/tower-unite-suitebro) by brecert
 - (Automatically installed by pip): numpy, scipy, requests, colorama, and any other Python packages in requirements.txt  

## Quick Installation
1. Download the `install-pytower.py` script from latest release
2. Run the installer script from command line using Python. For example, `python install-pytower-v0.2.0.py`. 
    - Alternatively, (on Windows) you can drag the install script onto python.exe or otherwise open the install script with python.exe

## Recommened Installation Instructions
1. (On Windows) Install Git Bash: https://git-scm.com/download/win. 
2. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/rainbowphysics/PyTower.git`. 
    - If typing `git` into the command line does nothing, you may have to add git manually to your PATH environment variable.
3. Run `install.bat` (on Windows) or `install.sh` (on Linux). 
    - Alternatively, directly run `pip install -e .`. (`-e` flag must be included, install will break without it!) 

### Troubleshooting
PyTower is a new piece of software and may be prone to bugs. For help installing and using PyTower, [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/NUufVuu4Ve).

Also see [Installation Guide](https://github.com/rainbowphysics/PyTower/wiki/Installation-Guide-&-Troubleshooting) and [Getting Started With PyTower](https://github.com/rainbowphysics/PyTower/wiki/Getting-Started-With-PyTower).

## Running PyTower
 - Once installed, PyTower can be run from command line as `pytower`
 - PyTower can also be run directly using `python -m pytower`
 - PyTower can also be imported into other Python projects with `import pytower`

### Available Subcommands:
 - `pytower help`: General help page
 - `pytower version`: PyTower version
 - `pytower convert`: Convert between CondoData and .json
 - `pytower backup`: (WIP) Canvas backup tool
 - `pytower scan <PATH>`: Scans path/directory for tool scripts
 - `pytower list`: List all detected tools
 - `pytower info <TOOLNAME>`: Get detailed information about `<TOOLNAME>` 
 - `pytower run <TOONAME> ...`: Run tool
 - `pytower config`: (WIP) Access config
 - `pytower fix <FILENAME>`: Fix broken canvas URLs in given file  

Example usages:
 - `pytower help`
    - Displays help about PyTower
 - `pytower info Tile`
    - Gets advanced info/help for tool "Tile"
 - `pytower scan .`
    - Scans current directory for tool scripts to add
 - `pytower run Rotate --output RotatedCondo --select group:4 -@ rotation=0,0,45 local=true`
    - Runs the "Rotate" tool with a group selection and passed-through parameters

## `pytower run` arguments
 - `-i`/`--input`: Input file to use (default: CondoData)
 - `-o`/`--output`: Output file to use (default: CondoData_output)
 - `-s`/`--select`: Selection mode to use (default: `items`)
 - `-v`/`--invert`: Flag to invert selection
 - `-j`/`--json`: Flag to skip Suitebro parser steps
 - `-g`/`--per-group`: Flag to apply the tool separately per group
 - `-@`/`--parameters`: Beginning of *tool parameters*
``
### Tool parameter format:
 - Parameters are separated by spaces and have the format `param=value`
 - For example, `pytower run MyTool -@ offset=0,0,300 foo=42` passes two parameters to MyTool: `offset` with the value `xyz(0,0,300)` and `foo` with the value `42`.

### Selection modes:
- `items` (default): Everything except property-only objects (CondoSettingsManager_2, Ultra_Dynamic_Sky_##, CondoWeather_2729, etc.)`
- `name:<NAME>`: Selects object by name (both custom name and internal object name)
- `customname:<NAME>`: Select objects by custom name (name assigned in game)
- `objname:<NAME>`: Select objects by internal object name only
- `group:<ID>`: Select objects by group id
- `regex:<PATTERN>`: Select objects by regular expression pattern (matches both custom name and object name)
- `all`: Everything including property-only objects
- `none`: Nothing (can be useful for generation tools)

## Writing tools scripts
To register a new tool to use with PyTower, simply create a new script in the tools folder with a main method. As input, the main method takes the save (as a `pytower.suitebro.Suitebro` object), the selection (as a `pytower.selection.Selection` object), and the parameters parsed by the main program (as a `pytower.tower.ParameterDict` object).

### Tooling script directives
- `TOOL_NAME`: Registers the name used by PyTower (by default it uses the script's file name)
- `VERSION`: Script version
- `AUTHOR`: Script author
- `URL`: External URL for more information (e.g., a link to a forum post)
- `INFO`: Further info printed when calling `pytower info <toolname>`
- `PARAMETERS`: Dictionary of required parameters and their types (registered as `ToolParameterInfo` instances)
- `HIDDEN=True`: Tells PyTower to hide and skip over this script. Useful for shared libraries
